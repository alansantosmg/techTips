[Verse]
 
F#m      D      A
You are, my fire,
F#m      D      A
The one, desire,
F#m      D      A
Believe, when I say,
F#m     E     A
I want it that way
 
F#m      D      A
But we, are two worlds apart,
F#m      D      A
Can't reach to, your heart,
F#m     D      A
When you say,
F#m     E     A
That I want it that way
 
 
[Chorus]
 
          D           E        F#m
Tell me why, (Ain't nothin' but a heartache)
          D           E        F#m
Tell me why, (Ain't nothin' but a mistake)
          D           E        A
Tell me why, I never wanna hear you say
      F#m       E       A
I want it that way
 
 
[Verse]
 
F#m      D      A
Am I, your fire,
F#m      D      A
Your one, desire,
F#m      D      A
Yes I know, it's too late,
F#m     E     A
But I want it that way
 
 
[Chorus]
 
          D           E        F#m
Tell me why, (Ain't nothin' but a heartache)
          D           E        F#m
Tell me why, (Ain't nothin' but a mistake)
          D           E        A
Tell me why, I never wanna hear you say
   F#m     C#
I want it that way
 
 
[Bridge]
 
 F#m                A
Now I can see that we're fallin' apart,
D                    E
From the way that it used to be, (Yeah)
F#m
No matter the distance,
A
I want you to know,
 D         E
That deep down inside of me...

The one, desire,
N.C.
You are, You are, You are, You are...
N.C.
(Don't wanna hear you say!)
